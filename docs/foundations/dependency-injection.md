# Dependency Injection

The project uses [**Koin**](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection (DI), allowing you to manage and inject dependencies in a clean, testable way.

* Shared DI setup in the `shared` module
* Platform-specific overrides supported
* Easy to extend or customize bindings
