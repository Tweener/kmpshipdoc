# Foundations

This section covers the technical foundations of your app, including Clean Architecture, dependency injection, image loading, network configuration, and API requests. These tools and patterns provide a scalable, maintainable base for building cross-platform apps with confidence.

-   __Clean architecture__

    ---

    Structure your app logic with a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns across data, domain, and presentation.

-   __Dependency injection__

    ---

    Manage and inject your dependencies using `Koin`, with shared modules and platform-specific overrides.

-   __Image fetching__ <small>(MVP Plan)</small>

    ---

    Load and display images efficiently across platforms using `Coil`, with built-in support for caching and smooth rendering.

-   __Networking__ <small>(MVP Plan)</small>

    ---

    Make safe and structured API requests using `Ktor`, with centralized configuration, error handling, and serialization.
