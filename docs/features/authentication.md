# Authentication

KMPShip includes built-in support for Firebase Authentication using [:simple-github: Passage](https://github.com/Tweener/passage/), allowing you to easily implement user authentication in your app.

---

## Prerequisite: Create a Firebase Project

!!! note

    You can skip this step if you already have a Firebase project set up. 

Before configuring authentication, you must have a Firebase project already set up.

If you haven't done this yet, follow the linked guide and connect both your Android and iOS apps before continuing:

ðŸ‘‰ [Create a Firebase Project](../tutorials/create-firebase-project.md)

## Supported providers

KMPShip supports the following authentication providers out of the box:

- [Google Sign In](#google-sign-in)
- [Apple Sign In](#apple-sign-in-ios-only)
- [Email & Password](#email-password)

None of these providers are mandatory â€” you can enable only the ones you need.

---

## Google Sign In

1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Google** as a provider.
3. Copy the **Web client ID** provided by Firebase.

### Android setup

Store the Web client ID in your `local.properties` file like this:

```properties
GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID={Web client ID provided by Firebase}
```

This value will be injected automatically into your Android build.

### iOS setup

1. Open the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file downloaded from Firebase.
2. Copy the values of the following keys:
     - `CLIENT_ID`
     - `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`

3. Open your appâ€™s `Info.plist` file and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>GIDClientID</key>
<string>YOUR_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID</string>

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>YOUR_REVERSED_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Replace:

- `YOUR_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID` with the `CLIENT_ID` value
- `YOUR_REVERSED_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_WEB_CLIENT_ID` with the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` value

## Apple Sign-In <small>(iOS only)</small>

To support Apple Sign-In in your app, you must:

1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Apple** as a provider.
3. Configure Apple Sign-In for iOS:

     1. Go to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) and:
          - Create a **Services ID**
          - Create a **Key** with **Sign in with Apple** enabled
          - Link both to your appâ€™s bundle identifier

     2. In Firebase:
          - Add your **Services ID**
          - Upload the **Key ID** and **Private Key**
          - Set your **Team ID** (found in the [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account) settings)

          - In Xcode:
            - Make sure the **Sign In with Apple** capability is enabled in your appâ€™s target under **Signing & Capabilities**
            - Confirm the appâ€™s **bundle identifier** matches the one registered in the Apple Developer Portal

---

## Email & Password

1. In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Email/Password** as a provider.

Once enabled, KMPShip provides:

- A built-in **Sign up** and **Sign in** form for email/password users.
- Support for **password reset**: users can receive a password recovery email and reset their password directly in the app.
- Support for **email verification**: users can verify their email address after signing up.
- Firebase error handling for common issues (e.g., invalid credentials, user not found).

!!! success "Authentication setup complete"

    You have successfully configured authentication in your KMPShip app. Users can now sign in using Google, Apple, or email/password methods.
