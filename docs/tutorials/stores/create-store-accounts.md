# 🏢 Create Store Accounts

To publish your app on both Android and iOS platforms, you’ll need to create accounts on their respective developer platforms.

> ⚠️ This is a **manual and mandatory** step. Unfortunately, it cannot be automated — you’ll need to go through each registration process yourself via the official stores.

This step is required before you can upload builds, configure store listings, or distribute your app through the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.
