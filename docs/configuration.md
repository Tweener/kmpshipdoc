# Configuration

Before you dive into using KMPShipâ€™s features, there are a few essential configuration steps to complete. These ensure that everything is set up correctly so you can enable services like authentication, analytics, and notifications later on.

This configuration is required and should be done **right after setup**, and **before attempting to use any feature module**.
